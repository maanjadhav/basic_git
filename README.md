# 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit card fraud detection dataset. The main objective is to understand patterns in transaction data, highlight the class imbalance between normal and fraudulent transactions, and gain insights that can be used in further modeling tasks.

## 📁 Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
🔗 [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

> 📝 **Credits**: The dataset was originally published by the Machine Learning Group - ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles). All data belongs to its original owners and is used here for academic and educational purposes only.

## 📊 Project Overview

This notebook contains a detailed EDA of the fraud detection dataset, including:

- Class imbalance analysis
- Visualization of `Amount`, `Time`, and anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`)
- Correlation heatmap
- Summary statistics
- Fraud vs non-fraud patterns

## 🧠 Key Learnings (Internship Outcome)

As part of my internship, this project helped me:

- Understand real-world financial data
- Analyze and visualize imbalanced datasets
- Gain hands-on experience using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Draw insights from large datasets for future predictive modeling
